**Scientific Calculator Documentation**

Welcome to the documentation for the Scientific Calculator! This calculator is designed to perform a variety of scientific calculations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, exponentiation, logarithms, and more. Below, you will find information on the calculator's features, functionality, and usage.

## Features

1. Basic Arithmetic Operators: The calculator supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.

2. Trigonometric Functions:You can perform trigonometric calculations using the sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions.

3. Exponentiation: The calculator allows you to calculate exponentiation using the power (^) operator.

4. Logarithmic Functions: You can compute logarithmic values using the natural logarithm (ln) and base-10 logarithm (log) functions.

5. Other Mathematical Functions: The calculator includes functions for calculating square roots (√), factorials (x!), percentages (%), and the mathematical constant pi (π).

6. Parentheses: Parentheses can be used to group and prioritize calculations.

7. Decimal Point: You can use the decimal point (.) to input decimal numbers.

8. Clear and Equals: The AC button clears the calculator's display, and the equals (=) button performs the calculation.

## Usage

1. Basic Arithmetic: Use the number buttons (0-9) and the arithmetic operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform basic arithmetic operations.

2. Trigonometric Functions: Press the sin, cos, and tan buttons followed by a number to calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of the given angle.

3. Exponentiation: Click the x^y button, input the base, press the comma (,), input the exponent, and then press the equals (=) button to calculate the result.

4. Logarithmic Functions: Use the ln button for the natural logarithm and the log button for the base-10 logarithm. Input the number and press the respective button.

5. Other Mathematical Functions: Press the √ button for square root, x! button for factorial, and pi (π) button for the mathematical constant.

6. Parentheses: Use the left brace "(" and right brace ")" buttons to group calculations within parentheses.

7. Decimal Point: Press the decimal (.) button to input decimal numbers.

8. Percentage: Input a number, press the percentage (%) button, and then press equals (=) to calculate the percentage.

9. Clear Display: Click the AC button to clear the calculator's display.

10. Calculation: After entering the desired expression, press the equals (=) button to calculate the result. The result will be displayed in the input field.

## Example

1. To calculate the square root of 16, press the "4" button, followed by the square root (√) button, and then press equals (=). The display will show "4".

2. To calculate sin(30), press the sin button, input "30", and press equals (=). The display will show the sine value.

3. To calculate 2 raised to the power of 3, press the "2" button, followed by the x^y button, input "3", and press equals (=). The display will show "8".

Remember that this calculator follows standard operator precedence rules, and you can use parentheses to control the order of operations.

Note: The calculator's appearance and functionality can be customized by modifying the associated CSS (style.css) and JavaScript (script.js) files.
